EMPLOYEE SALARY PREDICTION SYSTEM
This project aims to build an intelligent system that accurately predicts employee salaries based on various features such as experience, education level, job title, company, and location.
Using machine learning algorithms, the model learns from real-world datasets to estimate salaries and uncover patterns behind compensation.
The system helps job seekers understand their market value and supports HR teams in making data-driven decisions.

📌OVERVIEW
Employee Salary Predictor is a machine learning-based web application that intelligently predicts the expected salary of an employee based on multiple input features such as job title, experience, company, location, and more. The project is designed to assist HR professionals, recruiters, job seekers, and businesses in estimating appropriate compensation benchmarks for different roles. It uses a clean and user-friendly Streamlit interface to take user input, processes it through a trained regression model, and outputs a predicted salary with performance metrics and data visualizations. This tool is a practical example of how machine learning and web apps can be combined to create impactful real-world solutions.
